# memoires-decrypt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coding-robots/memoires-decrypt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/coding-robots/memoires-decrypt)

This cross-platform command-line program decrypts journals encrypted with
[Mémoires 4.0][mem] and later.  The result of decryption is the original
unencrypted journal (which is an SQLite database file).

*Of course, you need the original password to decrypt.*

The program is freely available under the 2-clause BSD license as an
anti-lock in initiative of [Coding Robots][cr], makers of Mémoires.
We support open standards and data portability.

## Installation

### Binary

Download a binary for your operating system from
[releases](https://github.com/coding-robots/memoires-decrypt/releases/).

### Sources

To install the program from sources, first install [Go programming language][go].
Then type the following command in Terminal:

	go get github.com/coding-robots/memoires-decrypt

This command will install `memoires-decrypt` into your $GOPATH/bin directory.


## Usage

	memoires-decrypt [-p="password"] -in="encrypted.memoire" -out="decrypted.memoire"

where:

	-in: encrypted journal file
	-out: decrypted SQLite file
